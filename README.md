# Block Vault – Decentralized Blockchain Based Document Management System

Block Vault is a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof document management platform that leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, and IPFS to eliminate the vulnerabilities of traditional centralized systems. It enables organizations to securely store, track, share, and verify documents with complete integrity, automation, and control.

---

## Project Overview

Block Vault addresses the growing need for secure digital documentation by eliminating:
- Unauthorized access
- Document tampering
- Version confusion
- Single point of failure in storage

Through blockchain immutability and distributed file storage, every document is:
- Encrypted and stored via IPFS
- Logged on Ethereum using content hash, timestamp, and metadata
- Governed by smart contracts to automate workflows like sharing, approving, and versioning

This ensures end-to-end transparency, traceability, and decentralization without relying on intermediaries — making it ideal for legal, financial, government, and multi-org collaborative use cases.

- Tamper-proof document storage
- Smart contract-based access rights
- Immutability with Ethereum blockchain
- IPFS-based distributed file storage
- Role-based workflow automation
